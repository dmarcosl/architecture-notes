# The Architecture Process

## Understand the system's requirements

The second thing the architect should do when beginning a work on a new system (**after understanding the goals**), is to **understand the system's requirements**

The requirements **describe what the system should do**

The requirements are **usually defined by the system analyst**, who works directly with the client

## Understand the non-functional requirements

Non-functional requirements **define some technical and service level attributes** of the system

The most common non-functional requirements are about **concurrent number of users, heavy loads volumes of data and performance**

They are **not always known to the client** or analyst, and it **is the architect job to help them to formulate them**

The non-functional requirements **are much more important than the regular requirements**

**Never should begin to work on a system before knowing exactly what non-functional requirements are**, because there are so many **architectural elements** that can be **affected by those requirements**

## Map the components

The **components are the capabilities of the system**

The component map serves **two goals**:

- Help to **understand the system functionality**
- **Communicate your understanding** to the client, **making sure you are not missing anything**

The component map **is completely non-technical**

## Select the technology stack

**Decide, together **with the development team**, what will be the platform on which the system will be based

Usually, the **back end platform, front end platform and data store platform**

There are **a lot of factors to consider**, and **the selection must be very rational**, because **a wrong technology stack can lead to failure of the whole system**

## Design the architecture

At this point you have the requirements, the non-functional requirements, the components and the technology stack**

What is left is to **design the architecture** that will glue all together, but it won't be formalized yet

## Write the architecture document

The architecture document **describes the whole process and give** the developers and management **a full picture of the system** that is going to be built

A good architecture document **must be relevant for all participants**

## Support the team

**The architecture will change** over the time

**The architect should** be with the developers to **help** them to make sure they are **developing according to the architecture**

**The work of an architect is not done until the system is in production**, and even then will probably be more
