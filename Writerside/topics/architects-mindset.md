# Architect's Mindset

## Understanding the Business

In order to **offer a real value** to the organization, you have to have a **deep understanding of the organization's business**

**Make** yourself **familiar** with:

- **Weaknesses**
- **Strengths**
- **Competitors**

## System's Goal

After understand the business, it's time to **look at the specific system we are going to work on**

The first thing is to look at the system's goals

We **do not need to know what the system should do**, that is a requirement, and it is important to distinguish it from a goal

We need to **know how the system will help the organization**

Usually, the **client is the one to describe the goals**
